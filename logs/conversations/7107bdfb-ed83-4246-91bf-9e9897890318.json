        "prompt": "How is Tesla Cashflow?",
        "response": "Applying quantitative analysis and financial statement analysis, we can evaluate Tesla's cash flow situation.\n\nFrom the [annual cash flow data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), we can see that Tesla's Free Cash Flow has been increasing over the years, from $968 million in 2019 to $7.55 billion in 2022. This indicates that the company is generating more cash than it is using, which is a positive sign for investors.\n\nHowever, the company's debt repayment has also increased significantly, from $389 million in 2019 to $3.866 billion in 2022. This could be a concern as it indicates that the company is taking on more debt.\n\nLooking at the [quarterly cash flow data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), we can see that Tesla's Free Cash Flow for Q2 2023 is $1.005 billion, which is a significant increase from $621 million in Q2 2022. This suggests that the company's cash flow situation is improving.\n\nIn terms of financing, Tesla has not issued any new debt or capital stock in recent quarters, which suggests that the company is not relying on external financing to fund its operations.\n\nOverall, Tesla's cash flow situation appears to be improving, with increasing free cash flow and no new debt issuance. However, the increasing debt repayment is a potential concern that should be monitored closely.",
