        "response": "Applying quantitative analysis and interpreting market data, Tesla's performance over the last month can be evaluated using various metrics. \n\nAccording to the data from [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/TSLA), Tesla's current stock price is $262.59. The 52-week change for Tesla is -11.40%, which is significantly lower than the S&P 500's 52-week change of 17.25%. This indicates that Tesla's stock performance has been weaker than the overall market over the past year. \n\nLooking at the 50-day average stock price, which is $256.18, it appears that Tesla's stock price has slightly increased over the past month. However, the stock price is still lower than the 52-week high of $313.8, indicating that the stock has not fully recovered from previous declines.\n\nIn terms of financial health, Tesla's current ratio (a liquidity ratio that measures a company's ability to pay short-term obligations) is 1.59. This suggests that the company has more than enough resources to cover its short-term liabilities.\n\nTesla's earnings growth is 20%, and its earnings quarterly growth is 19.7%, indicating a positive earnings trend. The company's EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is $16,796,999,680, which is a measure of a company's overall financial performance.\n\nIn conclusion, while Tesla's stock price has seen a slight increase over the past month, its performance over the past year has been weaker than the overall market. However, the company's financial health and earnings growth remain strong.",
